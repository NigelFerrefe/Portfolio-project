Portfolio project


Create your portfolio page with HTML, CSS and JS
You can find inspiration here for the colors, template, etc: https://dribbble.com/tags/simple-portfolio
The portfolio should include a description, your resume, your projects and the links to your linkedIn and github.
TO-DO:
Create a responsive navbar: the navbar can display the parts of your page: projects, resume, etc
In smaller screens we are not displaying the links but a hamburger icon
Create the hero section that includes a picture and your description. You can display it horizontally on desktop and vertically on mobile.
Create the projects section where you are going to display a card for each project with a screenshot and the links for the deployed version and github (we don't have projects now but we can add placeholders). For the responsive design we can display them vertically on mobile and horizontally on desktop (wrap?:cara_pensativa:)
Resume section where we are going to display our experience in previous jobs
Footer with extra information (social networks maybe...)
